## Installation

The application requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16.13.1

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd distributed_system
npm i 
npm start
```
The conf.env file contains the MongoDB URL. 
To access the database hosted in my MongoDB Atlas, please use the URL in the .env file.
The logins information for my database are:
user: admin 
pwd:admin

To run the dev mode (to use nodemon):

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Use

Once the server is running, to access the web application from a web browser go to:

```sh
http://localhost:3000
```
